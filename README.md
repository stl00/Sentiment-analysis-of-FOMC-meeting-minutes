# Sentiment analysis of FOMC meeting minutes - A neural network approach

In this paper, we explore the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sentiment
analysis of documents published by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). FOMC meeting
minutes play a crucial role in influencing economic assessments and beliefs about future policy, impacting
the global economy and financial markets. LSTM networks, with their ability to capture long-range
dependencies in sequential data, are well-suited for this task. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSTM
networks in sentiment analysis of FOMC meeting minutes. Furthermore, we attempt to extend the
model to predict financial market movements based on the sentiment analysis results.
